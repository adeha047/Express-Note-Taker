# EXPRESS NOTE TAKER README

  ## Description 

  This application tested requesting routes on the server side. 
  I created API routes to create get/post/delete requests from an API on the server side. 
   In the post request, when a user submits a form of data (a JSON object) the JSON is pushed to the proper JavaScript array. 
   I created a unique ID to delete a requested id or note from the server. 
   I created html routes that handle when a visitor visits a specific page in the site.
